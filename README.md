# Paradox Highlight

Syntax highlight for Paradox Script Languages

## Features

- Automatic check for builtin commands of Paradox Games
- Colorful syntax highlight

### Note

- Currently only Crusader Kings III is fully supported
- This extension focuses on new Paradox Games with Jomini engine (namely CK3 and Vic3), so for older games with Clausewitz engine (like EU4, CK2, or HOI4) might have less performance
